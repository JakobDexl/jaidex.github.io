# JAi blog and doc

# Contribute
Dear Contributer this page is used as a knowledge base for Maths and Informatics.
The page is divided into a blog and a wiki called docs.The main categories are named: ML(machine learning), DL(deep learning), Math and Computer.
The docs/blog posts should be straight forwoard and easy to understand. 
The main element of docs should be to provide a bridge between beginner and expert niveau (YES i know this is very difficult and subjective). In general this means: Describe the concept very simple and build it up by diving deep into math and code.
